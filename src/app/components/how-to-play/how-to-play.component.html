            <h2>CHOOSE A CATEGORY</h2>
            <P>First, choose a word category, like animals or movies. 
                The computer then randomly selects a secret word from that 
                topic and shows you blanks for each letter of the word.</P>

             <h2>GUESS LETTERS</h2>
             <P>Take turns guessing letters. 
                The computer fills in the relevant blank spaces if your guess is correct. 
                If itâ€™s wrong, you lose some health, 
                which empties after eight incorrect guesses.</P>

             <h2>WIN OR LOSE</h2>
             <P>You win by guessing all the letters in the 
                word before your health runs out. 
                If the health bar empties before you guess the word, 
                you lose.
            </P>
